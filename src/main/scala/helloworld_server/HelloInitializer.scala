    The Initializer is a long-lived object that is created once per Worker
    and manages the serviceâ€™s environment within the worker.

    Because Workers are single-threaded,
    Initializers provide a place to share resources among all connections handled by the worker.

    In particular this is often where outgoing connections to external services can be opened.
